# CSS-Demo

As per CSS3 task, I referred all the given link in trello.

Pseudo Class & Selector is interesting and FlexBox game is very exciting :)

Here I make one web page using all this stuff.

I Used Bootstrap, FlexBox properties, and many CSS3 properties.

I'am trying to make it responsive somehow, but unable to make fully responsive right now.
